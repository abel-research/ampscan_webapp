Running AmpScan Webapp
-------------------

Clone the repo using: `git clone https://github.com/abel-research/ampscan_webapp`

CD into directory using `cd ampscan_webapp`

(Optional) create new conda environment `conda create -n ampscan_environment python=3.6 pip --no-default-packages` and activate conda environment `conda activate ampscan_environment`

Install requirements with pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run development server using: `python manage.py runserver`

Now test it works by going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your webbrowser.

Maintainer Notes
----------------

This app uses a Django framework.

vtk.js is used to render the scans in the browser.

As a future improvement, we may want to add a modules bundler such as webpack rather than importing vtk.js scripts from a URL.

Please see the Issues for new features and improvements planned or in progress.
